                    <div class="project-title">High Risk Event Monitoring System</div>
                    <div>
                        Developed a monitoring system for tracking high-risk user activities on company machines.
                        The system collects and analyzes events to identify potential security threats and unauthorized
                        actions.
                        It processes a large volume of detailed logs, including individual commands executed on company
                        machines, which are correlated and aggregated into user activity sessions to provide contextual
                        insights into behavior.
                        The logs are continuously analyzed from a security perspective, using built-in detection logic
                        to automatically identify potentially dangerous actions, significantly reducing noise and
                        enabling faster incident response.
                        The system ingests data from multiple sources across the organization, including cloud services,
                        internal applications, and databases, enabling a unified view of activity and risk.
                        Utilized .NET 4.8 and .NET 8 for backend development, Angular versions 12 and 19 for frontend,
                        and MS SQL for data storage.

                        Significantly contributed to the project by automating CI/CD pipelines for all environments,
                        including production, using Azure DevOps.
                        The deployment process was enhanced with integration of unit tests and HTML reports for code
                        coverage, improving transparency and code quality tracking.
